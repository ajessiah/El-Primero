                While today’s newest yachts certainly deserve acclaim for their technical achievements, some of the most impressive works of craftsmanship, that remain highly regarded by generations of boating-lovers to this day, date back to more than a century ago.
                <br>
                <br>
                One such of these beloved and renowned vessels of innovation is El Primero, constructed in 1893, and aptly named ‘The First’, as it was the first steam yacht constructed on the West Coast of America.
                <br>
                <br>
                Its modeling inspired by Native American ocean canoes, the Clipper bow and hull hold the exact angle of those the early settlers used in their ocean-going vessels, and in turn reminiscent of the most classic sailing hulls, making it far easier to maneuver through waters, with or without an engine. In its earliest days, El Primero carried a set of emergency sails, just in case.
                <br>
                <br>
                Poised at over 120 ft. in length, with a teakwood and mahogany paneled interior, hand-carved wood cabinetry, two 225 horsepower triple-expansion engines, accommodations for up to 22 guest with a full crew, and an impressive 5,000 miles of cruising range, she was a categorical megayacht of her era.
                <br>
                <br>
                Droughting only 4ft of water at the bow, and 5ft at the stern, El Primero is built for speed, reef exploration, and shoreline cruises.
                <br>
                <br>
                With its reputation as the most luxurious boat afloat on the West Coast throughout the early to mid-1900s, it is confirmed to have transported at least four U.S. presidents: Taft, Harding, Hoover, and Roosevelt.
                <br>
                <br>
                During the 1950s, it stood as one of only two operational steam yachts remaining on the Puget Sound in the wake of World War II. The second yacht against whom El Primero raced in a wager some 30 years prior, ultimately winning despite the odds.
                <br>
                <br>
                With a build like no other vessel on the water today, a rich and ever-unfolding history, and the unique operational potential afforded to it by both, our mission is to give El Primero the future it deserves, and in turn the modern general public an authentic perspective into our vanished past.
